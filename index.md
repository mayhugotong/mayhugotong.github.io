## About Me
I am a Ph.D. student at at [LMU Munich](https://www.lmu.de/de/index.html) supervised by [Prof. Volker Tresp](https://www.dbs.ifi.lmu.de/~tresp/). I am an enthusiastic AI researcher in the field of Generative AI, foundational multi-modal models, large language models, with a special focus of reasoning on temporal data such as videos, dynamic graphs, etc. Prior to my PhD, I finished my Bachelor at [Beijing Institute of Technology (BIT)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing_Institute_of_Technology) and my Master at [Technical University of Munich (TUM)](https://www.tum.de/en/) in Electrical Engineering. After that I started my PhD program fully funded by [Munich Center of Machine Learning (MCML)](https://mcml.ai/) , the German permanent AI center. I am awarded with an additional personal funding of **130,000 Euro** from the [German Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF)](https://www.bmbf.de/bmbf/de/home/home_node.html) and [German Aerospace Center (DLR)](https://www.dlr.de/en), in collaboration with [Huawei Munich Research Center](https://www.huawei.com/eu/) aiming for supporting my research and cultivating me as the future tech lead.
